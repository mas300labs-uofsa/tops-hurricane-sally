Tropical cyclone data
"Data for Hurricane Sally were acquired from the best-track file as provided by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/)."

Clicking on that site will not work.

This site has data:
https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/

But it is all from 2023.  That is for 'current' best track.  

So a researcher needs to know where the best-track files are.  Here:
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_besttrack.php

Choose the year, 2020. Click Show Data.  Find Hurricane Sally, click on it.

You can just open the kmz's in Google Earth.

The search url for Hurricane Sally 2020 is:

And the files are
```

https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/best_track/al192020_windswath.kmz
```

The .zip file has shapefiles with the same information as the kmz's.
