# ScienceCore: Hurricane Sally

Our goal is to develop tutorials for data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in physical oceanography, using the following paper as a concrete example:
> B. Dzwonkowski, S. Fournier, G. Lockridge, J. Coogan, Z. Liu, and K. Park. [Hurricane Sally (2020) Shifts the Ocean Thermal Structure across the Inner Core during Rapid Intensification over the Shelf.](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/52/11/JPO-D-22-0025.1.xml) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 52(11), 2841-2852.

The article combines field data with satellite data to understand the sea surface temperature conditions associated with a hurricane undergoing rapid intensification over the continental shelf.

## Tasks

To follow Hurricane Sally (2020), we will need to find, download, and visualize
- Tropical Cyclone Best Track data ([NOAA National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/))
- Meteorological and hydrographic data ([NOAA National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/))
- Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution ([MUR](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1)) Sea Surface Temperature (NASA JPL)


## NASA's Transform to Open Science

This effort is funded by NASA's [Transform to Open Science](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science) Training (TOPST) program under award 80NSSC23K0863 to North Carolina State University with University of South Alabama.
