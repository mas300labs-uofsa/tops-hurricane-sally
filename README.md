# ScienceCore


ScienceCore is a curriculum of discipline-specific materials that showcase open-science workflows.

## What this is...
Our goal is to develop tutorials for the data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in physical oceanography, using the following paper as a concrete example. 

[Hurricane Sally (2020) Shifts the Ocean Thermal Structure across the Inner Core during Rapid Intensification over the Shelf](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/52/11/JPO-D-22-0025.1.xml). B. Dzwonkowski, S. Fournier, G. Lockridge, J. Coogan, Z. Liu, and K. Park.

## What this is *not*...

We hope to make data collection and coding tasks accessible to any student or researcher regardless of computing background, 
but the scientific conclusions are made by domain scientists, often with decades of experience.

## Let us know...

As we build this tutorial, please comment and post questions on any of the included computational science topics - we're here to help!  The domain science
topics are not in our scope, but perhaps we can point you to your nearest expert.
