# ScienceCore: Hurricane Sally

Our goal is to develop tutorials for the data collection, analysis methods, and visualization techniques used in physical oceanography, using the following paper as a concrete example. 

B. Dzwonkowski, S. Fournier, G. Lockridge, J. Coogan, Z. Liu, and K. Park. [Hurricane Sally (2020) Shifts the Ocean Thermal Structure across the Inner Core during Rapid Intensification over the Shelf.](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/52/11/JPO-D-22-0025.1.xml) Journal of Physical Oceanography, 52(11), 2841-2852.

The article combines field data with satellite data to understand the sea surface temperature conditions associated with a hurricane undergoing rapid intensification over the continental shelf.

The results
> suggest that coastal thermal features need to be accounted for to improve storm forecasting.


## Open-Source Science

From NASA'S Open-Source Science Initiative (OSSI):
> Open-source science requires a culture shift to a more inclusive, transparent, and collaborative scientific process, which will increase the pace and quality of scientific progress.

As part of the OSSI, course materials are being developed for Open Science 101, also called **OpenCore**.  Beyond the basics, it is often difficult
to find the time or motivation to study something not *specifically* and *immediately* applicable to our current workloads.  Enter ***ScienceCore***: 
> ScienceCore is a curriculum of discipline-specific materials that showcase open-science workflows.

So, *specifically*, we will find, download, and visualize
- Tropical Cyclone Best Track data ([NOAA National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/))
- Meteorological and hydrographic data ([NOAA National Data Buoy Center](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/))
- Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution ([MUR](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1)) Sea Surface Temperature (NASA JPL)

Our aim is to make it possible for you to start doing this *immediately*.  If you are having difficulties following along, please let us know so we
can improve these materials.

## Scope

We hope to make data collection and coding tasks accessible to any student or researcher regardless of computing background.  As we build this tutorial, please comment and post questions on any of the included computational science topics - we're here to help!

Scientific conclusions are made by domain scientists, often with decades of experience. Specific domain science questions are out of our scope, but perhaps we can point you to your nearest expert.
