Tropical cyclone data
"Data for Hurricane Sally were acquired from the best-track file as provided by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/)."

Clicking on that site will not work.

This site has data:
https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/

But it is all from 2023.  That is for 'current' best track.  

So a researcher needs to know where the best-track files are.  Here:
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_besttrack.php

Choose the year, 2020. Click Show Data.  Find Hurricane Sally, click on it.

GIS cumulative wind swath, track, points, wind radii for AL192020:

You can just open the kmz's in Google Earth.

The search url for Hurricane Sally 2020 is:
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/archive_besttrack_results.php?id=al19&year=2020&name=Hurricane%20SALLY

And the files are
```
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/best_track/al192020_best_track.kmz
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/best_track/al192020_best_track.zip
https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/best_track/al192020_windswath.kmz
```

The .zip file has shapefiles with the same information as the kmz's.

To provide additional context for the best-track data, model outputs of wind (north–south and east–west components) at 10-m height 
were collected from the North American Meso- scale Forecast System (NAM), which is produced by National
Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and archived at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). 
The NAM Analysis product was used (https://www.ncei.noaa. gov/data/north-american-mesoscale-model/access/analysis/). 
This product has a spatial resolution of 12 km and temporal resolution of 6 h. 
This modeling system is commonly used in hurricane re- search (e.g., Garzon et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2020).
