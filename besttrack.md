Tropical cyclone data
"Data for Hurricane Sally were acquired from the best-track file as provided by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (ftp://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/)."

Clicking on that site will not work.

This site has data:
https://ftp.nhc.noaa.gov/atcf/btk/

But it is all from 2023.  That is for 'current' best track.  

So a researcher needs to know where the best-track files are.  Here:
