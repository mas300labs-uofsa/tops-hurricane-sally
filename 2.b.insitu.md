# in situ data

## The stations
These stations were the closest measurements available to the main mooring site (CP). 

Monitoring stations:
- Dauphin Island (DI) 
- Orange Beach (ORB) 
- FOCAL/CP (CP)
- Perdido Pass (PP) 

Hydrographic data were available at all four stations, whereas meteorological data 
were only available at DI and ORB.

What is 'hydrographic' vs 'meteorological' data?

## NOAA National Data Buoy Center
Standard meteorological data from two NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC): 
- DPIA1 (DI) on Dauphin Island, Alabama. 
- 42012 offshore of Orange Beach, Alabama (ORB), 

The meteorological data included 
- air temperature
- relative humidity/dewpoint temperature (ORB only)
- wind speed and direction.

Google search for noaa national data buoy center.

The paper gives station ID, so we can search for that.  First is DPIA1 (what is DPHA1?**)
- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=DPIA1

To do a parameter search, e.g., find all records when air temperature is > 30, do:
- Historical search, https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/histsearch.php?station=dpia1
- Put parameters
- Get filtered text file of those observations
- The filtered file will have all variables, not just air temperature

Can't subset based on day, so we will get *all* historical data for 2020.

Click Method 2 to see what is there.  It will show up in the browser.

Then, under Method 1, right click and copy the link address:
https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/historical/stdmet/dpia1h2020.txt.gz

To get the code in the notebook:
```
!curl -O https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/historical/stdmet/dpia1h2020.txt.gz
```

Okay, DPIA has meterological and DPHA has hydrographic.

Also,
```
On 02/28/2023, Dauphin Island was disestablished. See the notice below for more details.
```

For Ocean data, like those used in the MAS labs, for 2020:
- https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/download_data.php?filename=dpha1o2020.txt.gz&dir=data/historical/ocean/

Use curl, since mac doesn't have wget.  Get the file, unzip it.  Define column names, read in the file and rename the columns.
```
!curl -O https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/historical/ocean/dpha1o2020.txt.gz
!gunzip dpha1o2020.txt.gz
!ls
vars = ['YY','MM','DD','hh','mm','depth','temp','cond','salt','o2percent','o2ppm','clcon','turb','ph','eh']
#verbose=True: indicate number of NA values placed in non-numeric columns
df =  pd.read_table("dpha1o2020.txt",skiprows=2,header=None,names=vars,sep='\s+',verbose=True)
df.head()
```
